### 💜 - I'm Panic! You can also call me Gamzee, Strider Or Creature! (Friends can call me Buddy though!)

















### 💚 -  My pronouns are it/its.

















### 💜 - I'm most likely to respond to you if I'm with friends! I'm very anxious and it's hard for me to talk to new people when I'm alone,,, I'm sorry if I come across as awkward or disinterested ,, My social skills are just lacking,, :<

















### 💚 - If you see me using a pony with [ 🎁'd ] in the name, it's a pony made by one of my friends!!! 🪲🦌

















### 💜 - I'm fine with people taking inspo from my skins!!! I think it's so cool when my silly ponies inspire people.. Just! Don't take inspiration from my gifted skins :O
